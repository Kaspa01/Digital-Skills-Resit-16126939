	  <h1>About myself</h1>
	  <p>I Would like to introduce myself: My name is Kasparas Litinskas, and i come from Vilnius, Lithuania(country in the Baltics)
	  21 years old, and studying in Netherlands. This is my first website, that i have made myself(With some help, of course).
	  I finished school at the age of 19, and after that, i started working in
      a technology distibution company, called TD Baltic.
	  In there i worked as Product Information specialist, so i learned.
      more about the products, and how to manage a internet shop style website. Lithuania: Little country in the Baltics, and it has about 3 milion people living in there.
	  Also it has a huge and deep history, starting from 1009, when Lithuania's name become know in Europe.
	  And from that, Lithuania is still alive,even after all the difficulties my country had to overcome. After WW2 it was occupied by USSR
	  and after 50 years of protests and attempts. On 1990 March 11, Lithuania delcared it's independance from USSR</p>

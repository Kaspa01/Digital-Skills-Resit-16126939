        <p>All my life, i was amazed by cars and motorcycles, all my life, i was surrounded by motorcycles. My dad traveled almost every country
      in Europe on a motorcycle. I stared ridind motorcycles from a age of 8
      and still ride them, even after some crashed, that still remind me in a form of scars.Second hobbie for me is Cars. The love for cars was always influenced by movies, video games, and always getting into a new car. My dad used to sell used car's, and seing a lot of car's i started to get more involved into car's. I love Old School cars, just of their looks, performance and a influence, it can have on people's lives</p>
